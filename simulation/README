This Directory contains the R scripts and relevant data to generate the simulated data set used in Wen 2013. The detailed simulation information can be found in the paper section 6. 

sim_indep.R: this R script generates simulated data based on simulated independent covariates. The outputs are: sim.truth (the truth), sim.dat (formated to be run with sbams_mvlr), sim.r.dat (formated to be run with LASSO).

sim_region.R: this R script generates simulated data based on true correlated SNP data. The outputs are:sim.truth (the truth), sim.dat (formated to be run with   sbams_mvlr), sim.r.dat (formated to be run with LASSO).

lasso.R: this R script is for analyzing the simulated data using lars algorithm, it directly works with sim.r.dat generated by either sim_indep.R or sim_region.R.  


sim.geno.region: the extracted genotype data used by sim_region.R
